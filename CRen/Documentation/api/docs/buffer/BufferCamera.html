<h2>BufferConstant</h2>
<p><strong>File:</strong> cren_buffer.h</p>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> C Struct</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
    Stores camera data accessible across all shaders via a Uniform Buffer Object (UBO), offering optimal performance for scene-wide constants.
    Data is uploaded once per frame and reused globally.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">typedef struct BufferCamera
{
    align_as(16) fmat4 view;
    align_as(16) fmat4 viewInverse;
    align_as(16) fmat4 proj;
} BufferCamera;
</code></pre>

<h3>Members</h3>
<h4>view:</h4>
<p>The camera's view matrix.</p>

<h4>viewInverse:</h4>
<p>The camera's view inverse matrix, this is calculated on CPU and maintaned internally because is faster.</p>

<h4>proj:</h4>
<p>The camera's projection matrix, calculated on CPU as it's faster.</p>
