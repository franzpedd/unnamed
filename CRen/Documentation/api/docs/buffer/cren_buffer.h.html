<h2>cren_buffer.h</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    Defines all buffers utilized throughout the rendering pipeline. While this abstraction currently offers limited user-facing functionality,
    it establishes the foundation for future usability once its efficiency is validated.
</p>

<h3>Code implementation</h3>
Code implementation can be found <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/franzpedd/unnamed/blob/main/CRen/Source/cren_buffer.c">here</a>

<div class="todo">
    <strong>Missing abstraction:</strong> Right now buffer is handled by the vulkan only, but this may change a bit in future releases.
