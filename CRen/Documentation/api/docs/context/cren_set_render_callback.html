<h2>cren_set_render_callback</h2>
<p><strong>File:</strong> cren_context.h</p>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> C Function</p>
<h3>Description</h3> 
<p>
    This function assigns a callback to be executed during Vulkan's command buffer recording for rendering.
    It provides some control over the draw process, allowing you to decide which objects to render (since the drawing is a function per object) and, most importantly, 
    the exact timing of when the drawing commands are issued within the frame's command sequence.
